    "First before you begin you will have to gain access to the IS&P research data and the Dow Jones news feed. \n",
    "To get to the data you will need to do the following: \n",
    "    \n",
    "1.  Clone the github repo (which you've probably already done) located here. \n",
    "2.  Locate the cert file within the repo and make note of it (you will insert the file path below).\n",
    "3.  Get the ElasticSearch password from one of the Credit Suisse organizers.\n",
    "4.  Make sure you have PIP installed the latest SSL and ElasticSearch Libraries.\n",
    "5.  Next in the code below you will have to point the context variable to the cert you just downloaded from this git     repo and enter the password we will give you in the http_auth argument.  \n",
    "6.  Run the code and you are off to the races!  \n",
    "\n",
    "##  So whats in the data? and where and how are you processing it?\n",
    "We are using ElasticSearch 7.1 hosted within a Kubernetes cluster on the Google Cloud running within Zurich.  \n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with ElasticSearch you can read more about it here:  https://www.elastic.co, \n",
    "be sure to read about the 7.1 version docs.\n",
    "                           \n",
    "## There are two indexes within the ES cluster you will be connecting to:\n",
    "1.  isp: This is the internal Credit Suisse research.  There are 10,000 documents in this index.  The data model is \n",
    "    pretty straight forward once you begin hitting the cluster and digging in.\n",
    "2.  dj:  This is the DowJones machine readable news feed.  The data model is much more robust than IS&P's so below you find an example.\n",
